            <p>First and foremost, thank you for taking time out of your day to visit my portfolio website. My name is Trey Hope, a 24 year old web/mobile developer, graphic designer, and software development fanatic. I am a native of Trotwood, Ohio and an alumni of Northern Kentucky University, with a BS in Computer Science. While in college, I became a member of the Rho Gamma Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., National Pan-Hellenic Council (N.P.H.C.) President, as well as
              a member of Order of Omega. Once I graduated, I moved to Colorado to become a Custom Software Developer for Amadeus Consulting in Boulder, Colorado. Currently, I work at DTT in Los Angeles, California as a AngularJS/PHP developer.</p>
            <p>Living a life of shear hapiness and love is my goal, as well as ensuring those around me are visially aware of their possibility for hapiness as well. With that in mind, I believe everything else
              will fall into place. <strong>Agápē</strong>.
